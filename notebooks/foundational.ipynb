    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "What do you know about star properties, such as their size, temperature and energy output? This investigation will give you the opportunity to create your own \"window\" to the stars, and explore what the view through that window can reveal about star properties.  \n",
    "Today you will be using a data visualization tool developed more than a century ago called the [H-R Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung–Russell_diagram). The designation H-R refers to the two astronomers who developed the first such plot: [Ejnar Hertzsprung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejnar_Hertzsprung) from Denmark, and [Henry Norris Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell), an American.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare stars to each other, and measure properties such as their energy output, it is important to have a way to control for distance in space. Two stars of the same brightness would look very different if one was farther away from Earth than the other. One way to eliminate that problem is to collect data from a group of stars in a [star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster). By using a cluster, you can make an assumption that all of the stars are the same distance away. Today you will collect and analyze data for the stars in one cluster, and try to understand what you can learn from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this investigation, the term [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity) refers to the total energy output from a star. Luminosity is a ratio of the star's energy output to the Sun, so a star with a luminosity of 10 is 10 times brighter than the Sun."
